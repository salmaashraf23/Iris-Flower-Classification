# Iris-Flower-Classification
Dataset Details:
Features:

Sepal Length: The length of the sepal in centimeters.
Sepal Width: The width of the sepal in centimeters.
Petal Length: The length of the petal in centimeters.
Petal Width: The width of the petal in centimeters.
Classes (Species):

Iris Setosa
Iris Versicolor
Iris Virginica
Dataset Composition:
Total Samples: 150
50 samples for each species.
Data Format: Typically provided in CSV or similar tabular format with columns for each feature and the species label.
Objective:
The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify the species of an iris flower based on the four features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

Applications:
Educational Purposes: The simplicity of the dataset makes it ideal for teaching basic machine learning concepts.
Algorithm Benchmarking: It serves as a standard benchmark for testing and comparing the performance of various classification algorithms.
Steps in the Classification Process:
Data Exploration and Visualization:

Understand the distribution of the data.
Visualize relationships between features using plots (e.g., scatter plots, histograms).
Data Preprocessing:

Handle any missing values.
Normalize or scale the features if necessary.
Model Selection and Training:

Choose appropriate classification algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines).
Train the model using the training dataset.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Use techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness.
Prediction:

Use the trained model to classify new iris flower samples.
The Iris Flower Classification problem is fundamental in understanding the principles of classification and can be expanded to explore more advanced machine learning techniques and algorithms.
